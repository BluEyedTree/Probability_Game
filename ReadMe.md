Implementation of the following probability Game:

The goal of the game is to predict the chance of winning from any location n turns from the end of the game. The end goal is to make it to the green square, while hitting a red square results in an immediate lose. You can pick a direction of your move to any neighboring pixel. However, 40% of the time you will move exactly there and 60% of the time you will move randomly to any of the available neighboring pixels. 


The bar on the right represents your chance of winning if you start from that given location and have n turns (seen as the iteration number on top) to run the game. 


Below is an example of the game at the 13th iteration:
